Team Technocrats welcome you to contribute your snippets and working codes with us.

Quick Recap for contributing.

- Make a new folder with name `YourName_username` (For example: SufiyanAnsari_suffisme)
- If already existing then simply head over it, don't create it everytime
- Then add your file there with the proper name showing the basic functionality of that code you are sharing, For example: `API_fetch.py` clearly shows a py file for fetching data via API
